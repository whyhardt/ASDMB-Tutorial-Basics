## Study

In this example study, we are interested in **cognitive control**. To examine this, we will use a **Stroop Task**, in which participants see color words displayed in different ink colors and must respond to the color rather than the wordâ€™s meaning. Performance is compared between *congruent* trials (e.g., the word <span class="colored red">RED</span> shown in red) and *incongruent* trials (e.g., the word <span class="colored blue">RED</span> shown in blue), allowing us to measure accuracy differences that reflect congruency effects.

### Creating the Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/younesStrittmatter/ASDMB-Tutorial-Basics](https://github.com/younesStrittmatter/ASDMB-Tutorial-Basics) and use as template. Top-right-corner: <span class="github-button">Use this template â–¼</span> â†’ Create a new repository
2. Open the repository in Codespaces: <span class="github-button"><> Code â–¼</span> â†’ Codespaces 


---
### Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment (in the terminal):

```shell

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Add .gitignore to root folder with entry .venv:
```file
.venv
```

### Project Structure
> [Testing Zone](#testing-zone)
> [Researcher Hub](#researcher-hub)

---

####  Testing Zone
>Path: <project_name>/testing_zone

This is the participant-facing website, implemented mainly in JavaScript.

No changes are needed here (**you donâ€™t have to write any JavaScript**).

For advanced users:
If you prefer not to use SweetBean (Python) and would rather use a frontend library like [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/latest/) to generate stimuli, you can customize the file `testing_zone/src/design/main.js` to fit your needs

---

#### Researcher Hub
>Path: <project_name>/researcher_hub

This is the researcher-facing workspace, where you will write all of your code.


---

#### AutoRA State
AutoRA operates on a state object that holds all data relevant to a study, including:

- *Variable definitions*
- *Experimental conditions*
- *Experimental data*
- *Fitted models*

---

#### AutoRA Modules

The state is passed between agents, each acting on it in different ways.
AutoRA defines three core agents mainly defined by their output (but you can extend this with your own):

- *Experimentalist*: Creates new experimental conditions or experiments (may use variable definitions, data, or fitted models).
- *Theorist*: Proposes and fits models (primarily uses experimental data).
- *Experiment Runner*: Takes experimental conditions and generates new data (for example by runninge the experiments on synthetic models or online on real participants)

---

## Our First Study

**ðŸ’¡ Idea (Theory)**
Do people adapt their cognitive control depending on the context?

<br>

**ðŸ§ª Manipulation (Test)**
Does the frequency of congruent vs. incongruent trials influence the size of the congruency effect?

---

### Variables

**IV**:

*congruency_frequency*: (.1, .2, ..., .0)

**DV**:

*congruency_effect (difference beetween RTs)*: (-2000, 2000)

---

```python
variables = VariableCollection(
    independent_variables=[
        Variable(
            name="congruency_freq", 
            allowed_values=[25, 50, 75])
        ],
    dependent_variables=[
        Variable(
            name="congruency_effect", 
            value_range=(-100, 100))
        ]
    )
```
---

## Theorist

Linear regression: `congruency_effect ~ congruency_frequency`

---

## Experimentalist

Randomly chose `congruency_frequency` from `allowed_values`

---

## Experiment Runner: SweetPea

SweetPea: Trial Sequences

(1) Regular Factors: *word*, *color*
(2) Derived Factor: *congruency* 

**Manipulation:**

*weight* of congruent vs incongruent trials

---

```python
color = Factor('color', ['red', 'green'])
word = Factor('word', ['RED', 'GREEN'])

congruency = Factor(
    'congruency', 
        [
            DerivedLevel('congruent',
                         WithinTrial(lambda x, y: x.lower() == y.lower(), [color, word]),
                         weight=int(row['congruency_freq'] / 25)),
            DerivedLevel('incongruent',
                         WithinTrial(lambda x, y: x.lower() != y.lower(), [color, word]),
                         weight=int(4 - row['congruency_freq'] / 25)),
        ]
    )    

design = [color, word, congruency]
crossing = [color, congruency]
constraints = []
```

---

## Experiment Runner: SweetBean

![stroop](assets/stroop.png)

---

```python
seq = [
        Fixation(duration=800),
        Text(
            duration=2000,
            text=TimelineVariable('word'),
            color=TimelineVariable('color'),
            correct_key=FunctionVariable(
                name='correct_key',
                fct=lambda x: 'f' if x == 'red' else 'j',
                args=[TimelineVariable('color')]),
            choices=['f', 'j']),
        Feedback(duration=800)
        ]
```

---

## Postprocessing The Data

trial data -> table with *IVs* and *DVs*

---

```python
df.to_csv("sample.csv")
    
df['congruent'] = df['bean_text.1'].str.lower() == df['bean_color.1'].str.lower()

grouped = df.groupby('exp_id')

con_acc = df[df['congruent']].groupby('exp_id')['bean_correct.1'].mean()
inc_acc = df[~df['congruent']].groupby('exp_id')['bean_correct.1'].mean()

# Fill this with ivs and dvs
summary = pd.DataFrame({
    'congruency_freq': grouped['congruent'].mean() * 100,
    'congruency_effect': con_acc * 100 - inc_acc * 100,
})

```
